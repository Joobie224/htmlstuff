    <!-- only put anything that doesn't directly appear on the screen. You can start writing CSS in the style tag -->

    <!-- this line put the included styles on everything:
         * {
          border: 2px solid purple;
         } 
    -->

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />

    <!-- Border:
            it doesn't matter what order it goes in 
            It just matteres that you ahve all 3 of these attributes in it:
            - size (in px or rem or whatever)
            - solid / dashed / dotted
            - color
    -->

    <!-- If you have a css in the style, it takes up a lot of space in your html, so here's how you import css into your html file. 
         1. create new file under the HTML file called "style.css"
         2. create your css code within that file
         3. remove entire style tag from HTML file
         4. then create this:
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />

    <h3>What do I hope to gain from this bootcamp?</h3>
    <p>
      I wanted to take this opportunity to make a hard pivot from my current
      career to a new one in tech, which has always been my fascination and
      interest.
